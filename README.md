# Funny Simulations  [Python, Pygame, Pymunk]

In this project, you will find several implementations of different **funny simulations** for you to learn how to use ```Python```, ```Pygame```, and ```Pymunk```.

The simulations presented here can be **customized as you want**. Each directory has its own ```config.yml``` with all the parameters and variables than can be modified as you wish.

### TODO: add photo of all of them.

## Project Structure

## Getting started

First, ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

Before installing the Python libraries used in this project, you may want to create a Python Virtual Environment ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)), to avoid problems if you are working on other projects as well.

The Python Libraries used in this project are listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file. There you will find the Python libraries and their versions. You may use a package manager called ```pip``` to install them. If ```pip``` is not installed, you need to install it. If you have *Python 3.4* or newer, ```pip``` should come pre-installed.

Run the following command to install the libraries listed in your requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After running the command, pip will download and install the specified packages and their dependencies. You can verify that the libraries were successfully installed by checking their versions:
```
pip list
```

## About Pygame
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides a simple way to create games and multimedia applications. It provides a straightforward and efficient way to manage graphics, sound, user input, and basic collision detection. In this project, Pygame is used to create a graphical interface for every simulation.

## About Pymunk
[PyMunk](https://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/pymunk.html) is a Python library that extends Pygame by adding robust 2D physics simulation capabilities, allowing developers to create realistic physics interactions within their 2D games and simulations. It provides functionality for creating and managing physics objects such as rigid bodies, shapes, constraints, and handling complex collision detection and response.

PyMunk's integration with Pygame simplifies the process of combining graphics with dynamic physics, making it a valuable tool for those seeking to develop games or simulations with compelling and lifelike physics behavior.

## About YAML
[YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/) (*"Yet Another Markup Language"*) is a human-readable data serialization format. It's often used for configuration files, data exchange between languages with different data structures, and in various applications where data needs to be stored, transmitted, or configured in a human-readable format. YAML's design aims to be simple and easy for both humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate.
